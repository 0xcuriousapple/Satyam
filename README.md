Anonymous whistleblower
Satyam...An anonymous whistleblower. Many journalist face life threats just because they published something which they are not supposed to talk about, be it Jamal Khashoggi or many brave journalists who died because of stories they broke. 
Now consider a web app where you can break a story without revealing your identity,
That's what Satyam is.
The obvious problem with this spamming and cyberbullying, whenever you hide the identity of the person it can be used for the wrong means.
That's where the magic of crypto comes, whenever someone publishes story on Satyam they will need to stake on their story. and now if the community thinks this is something platform should have they will upvote if they don't they will downvote. After some time depending upon votes of people either the stake will be returned back to the publisher or it will go to developer.
